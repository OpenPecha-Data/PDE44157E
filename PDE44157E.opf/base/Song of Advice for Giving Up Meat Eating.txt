Song of Advice for Giving Up Meat Eating

by Nyala Pema Dündul

When I think of the suffering that meat eating brings,I cannot bear the pain and anguish I feel
within my heart.

Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ hrīḥ!

From a state of emptiness and compassion, you guide beings — Noble Avalokiteśvara, to you I
pay homage.

Without having trained in love and compassion myself,I ate the flesh of my mothers while lecturing
others about cause and effect.Without realizing the absolute, I wandered along the
path of empty words.I, the parrot-like beggar of White Rock,Was practicing austerities and
‘extracting the essence’,[1]When, one day, while meditating on Lord Avalokiteśvara,According
to the union of stages from Self-Liberation Equal to Space,[2]My own body and everything
around me suddenly disappearedAnd transformed into a luminous body like that of the Great
Compassionate One,Seemingly floating in space.

As I looked around while experiencing luminous awareness,I saw the inconceivable miseries of
the lower realms.And, in particular, the vast sufferings of the Reviving Hell.One of its
quarters, I saw, was completely filledWith men and women, naked and helpless, before each
of whomStood throngs of evil-looking servants with headsLike birds, wild and domesticated
animals, and ferocious beasts.Many of the servants held sharp weapons in their hands,With
which to slice apart and devour the flesh of their victims.Time and again they cut, and time
and again flesh grew back.Victims did not expire until their karma was fully exhausted,And
habitual tendencies did not diminish, but only increased.For those who had performed ‘red
offerings’ it was even worse.Loudly, they all screamed in terrible pain and agony.When
I had seen this external manifestation of my own perception,I wondered what might be done
to stop such suffering.

And, in that very instant, in the sky before me,The Great Compassionate One appeared, and said:


“Ema! My son, who has been close to me throughout many lives,Listen well now, you who are diligent
and determined!You have gained stability in the generation stage of deity yoga,And
have even developed a few qualities,But the root of Dharma lies in loving kindness and compassion.Do
you have real love and compassion within yourself?How could anyone trained in compassion
ever eat flesh?Just look at how eating meat brings such suffering!The results of
our own actions will ripen on us alone;There is nothing the buddhas of the three times may
do.Eating meat has no virtue whatsoever but entails many faults.It is the source of 400
forms of disease and 80,000 obstructing forces,And it naturally brings about the 84,000 afflictive
emotions.Other than as part of the fearless conduct of benefitting all one encounters,Or
as a medicine or sacred substance of the supreme Secret Mantra,Consumption of flesh
involves not the tiniest trace of virtue.Eating flesh is a sign of being either a māra or
rākṣasa demon.It causes discipline to degenerate and negative emotions to increase.Without
the cause, which is altruistic love and compassion,You will find it hard to gain the fruit,
the essence of awakening.Meat eaters are not accompanied by the wisdom deities.They lack
blessings, accomplishment, auspiciousness and activity.The substance of altruism does
not develop in eaters of flesh,Whom gods, nāgas and others regard as demons.Meat eaters are
plagued by gandharvas, rākṣasas, māras,Yamas, ghosts, spirits, gyalpo, gongpo, and samaya-breaking
demons.The result of eating meat is rebirth in the hells,Or as a bird, a jackal,
a cannibal demon, or the like.Meat eating thus brings suffering beyond measure.But by renouncing
it, you are freed from all these faults,And will always be revered by non-human beings,Who
will see you as a pure, authentic brahmin or god.All the buddhas and bodhisattvas,
together with their retinues, throughout the ten directions,Gurus, yidam deities and ḍākinīs
will gather around you like clouds,And you will be accompanied by male and female bodhisattvas.Quite
naturally, you will possess the cause of loving kindness and compassion,And
swiftly reach the fruit, which is the essence of awakening.These are just some of the inconceivable
virtues to be gained.”

Thus he spoke; and then, once my own perception had returned,I felt as if I had awakened from
a lucid dream.My body and mind were tormented as if I had swallowed poison,And I shook with
fear and panic.Just thinking of the terrible sufferings of the Reviving Hell,I wished
only to exchange my happiness for others’ pain.So utterly overwhelmed was my mind, I wept
profusely.And I felt intense, unbearable compassion.Then, to take upon myself the sufferings
of others,And to purify their faults and obscurations caused by eating meat,For every mother
sentient being, as infinite in number as space is vast,I made the following vow, true
according to the two levels of reality:

“Aho! Mighty sage Śākyamuni and all buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the whole of space and
time,Have compassion for this child who knew nothing of cause and effect!Hosts of gracious
root and lineage masters, care for me!Have compassion for this child who knew nothing
of cause and effect!Supreme yidam deity, mighty Avalokiteśvara, care for me!Have compassion
for this child who knew nothing of cause and effect!

Overwhelmed by ignorance and the two obscurations,I have often spoken of how all infinite beings
have been our parents,And while living off their flesh, lectured about cause and effect.I
had no idea that the suffering involved was so great!Often have I heard it said that
eating meat with threefold purity[3]Is sanctioned by the Buddha and does not count as sin.But
this applies only to saints who benefit all they encounter,Like pure lotus flowers, unstained
by negative emotions,And to practitioners of the profound path of Secret Mantra.For
my part, I have no instruction more profoundThan altruistic love and compassion,And the
infallibility of cause and effect.To purify all the faults and obscurations of eating fleshAmong
all sentient beings, who extend throughout the whole of space,From this moment on,
I completely renounce the eating of flesh.This is my unfailing commitment, which I shall never
forsake.Even if all the animals upon this earth were to be devoured,There would still
be no satisfaction; hunger would only continue to increase.Deprived of food or drink for
just a few days,We feel as if we have never tasted even so much as a single morsel or drop
before.Now is the time to escape this demon, hunger.What, after all, is the cause of this
flesh?It springs only from self-clinging and attachment.Merely to think of it makes me weary,
nauseated.This utterly unappetizing mound of mess and filth,Bound up with the thirty-six
impure substances,A body of habitual patterns and aggregates, is the basis for all suffering.Each
animal has its own negative actions,And whoever eats the flesh of such beings
will find it hard to win liberation.Meat and alcohol are impure substances,And to offer them
does not count as generosity, the Buddha said.Who, therefore, would eat this food of the
afflictions?Pretas must live for many thousands of human yearsWithout seeing food or drink,
enduring only suffering.But we human beings gladly drink even ice-cold water,And have
plenty to sustain us besides meat and alcohol.If we are still not satisfied by such delights,How
could we repay past kindnesses so unfairly?Throughout the course of countless aeons
pastIn every world within this universe so vast,[4]There’s not a single being who has not
been our mother.And the milk we drank from maternal breasts would fill a billion seas.I abandon
all pretence; let the Three Jewels be my witness!In the past, under the sway of ignorance
and habit,I ate my parents’ flesh and did not remorsefully confess.Now with pure motivation
and the four powers complete,As in the saying, “I was not, am not, and will not be
attached,”Henceforth, may the thought of eating meat never even cross my mind.Should I ever
fail, let the Three Jewels send their punishment.May the protectors and guardians constantly
keep watch.Were I now to eat the flesh of my past mothers,There would be no greater
transgressor in all the three realms!The Buddha said that harming others even slightly impairs
one's vows.So what need is there to mention flesh eating which involves taking life?In
the Parinirvāṇa Sūtra, Laṅkāvatāra and elsewhere, it is saidThat eating meat is tantamount
to killing.It is forbidden in both the greater and lesser vehicles,But is particularly
unacceptable for bodhisattvas.Our Teacher himself, when he appeared as a partridge’s young,And
as a ferocious beast[5] in the wild, would not eat meat.How then could we, his followers,
ever do so?In accordance with the guidance of the Victorious One,There were many great
masters in India and Tibet who gave up meat.As all this shows, the faults of meat eating
are unimaginably vast.Not cultivating negativity is itself genuine Dharma.So may I always
comply with the authentic teaching!"

Having seen the boundless faults that come from eating meat,Even the thought of it is as nauseating
as poison.And so, I, the great beggar with the name of Dündül,Composed these words
of advice to encourage my own renunciationIn the Sky Fortress hermitage of White Rock.As
a result of this virtue, may all sentient beingsPurify all the faults and obscurations that
come from eating meat,So that they may see the thousand buddhas face to face!

he even refers to himself on occasion as a ‘stone-eating yogin’ (rnal ’byor rdo zan) — a
reference to his time spent imbibing the essence of rocks and minerals in the form of pills.

Pema Düdül.  ↩ This means that you have not seen or heard anything to indicate that the
meat has been butchered specifically for you, and not only that, you do not even have any
doubt that this might be the case.  ↩ Literally, "in all seven worlds" ('jig rten bdun
