Drodung Monastery Guidelines

by Katok Shingkyong Jigme Dechen Dorje & Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Namo guru!

Relying upon them dispels the terrors of existence,And merely hearing a fragment of their names,Keeps
saṃsāra's dire dominions at bay—To the three incomparable precious jewels, I bow.


What follows are regulations for the residents of Drodung Sang-ngak Chöling, founded on the
site where the Ngupa siddha Chökyi Dorje of the Dharma lineage of the great Shar Katokpa,[1]
master of the kama and terma teachings of Ancient Translations, had a vision of vīras and
ḍākinīs dancing spontaneously among the pine trees.

As determined by the benefactors, monk-providing areas (grwa rtsa) should supply entrants to
the monkhood without decline, and none but these monk suppliers can prevent anyone from entering
the monastery.

Teachers should care for new monks skilfully, helping them to master the black and white scripts[2]
and memorize the daily recitations (chos spyod) and other essential texts. From the
age of ten, monks should take novice ordination, and from the age of around nineteen they
should travel to Katok in order to take full ordination. Rituals and daily recitations should
be performed according to the traditions of Katok and Orgyen Mindrolling.

During the stricter periods of the summer and winter monks must stay in place for two months
at a time. Breaking this rule at either time will be penalized with a fine of twenty gor.


The Praise of the Vinaya says:

Just as the main roots of a treeProvide a foundation for its growth and all that it bears,So
the basis and source of all aspects of the sacred DharmaIs taught to be the Vinaya.[3]

Given that the Vinaya is the foundation of the teachings, all novices and fully ordained monks
must maintain the five vows: i.e., not to kill, not to steal, not to have sexual relations,
not to make false claims about supernatural attainment, and not to consume alcohol. Rules
concerning females and alcohol consumption in particular must be strictly enforced at
all times. Any transgressions will be penalized according to the written rules.

The rainy season retreat (dbyar gnas; varṣā) and the practice of 'healing and restoration' (gso
sbyong; poṣadha) are indispensable, so it is important to learn the ways in which they
observed. Learn to write properly according to the best tradition.[4] Intelligent individuals
should also train in the outer and inner sciences. Chant leaders, shrine masters and
others must learn how to draw maṇḍalas with coloured sand, how to make and decorate tormas,
how to perform rituals, how to play the three types of musical instrument (those that are
blown, beaten and chimed), and how to chant.

Having long hair is forbidden, as is the carrying of pocket knives. Angry quarrels and fighting
will be punished swiftly. Assembly in the monastic hall is required for all but the most
incapacitated. You should remain within the monastery compound as much as possible, because
wandering at length through the towns and villages of lay people is the root of non-virtue.
Set your sights high, therefore, and make the most of your freedoms and advantages.


In short, it is crucial that you adopt and avoid actions according to their effects, that you
remain harmonious and share a common purpose, and that you purely maintain both outer and
inner vows.

In response to an instruction from Shibcha Tulku Losal, and since we wish to assist in both
happiness and suffering and recognise the vital importance of not confusing what should be
adopted and avoided,[5] this was written by the Katok throneholder Shingkyong[6] and Jamyang
Khyentse Tulku during the month of miracles in the Fire Mouse year (1936).
